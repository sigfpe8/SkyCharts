## SkyCharts

This is a p5.js sketch that allows one to display sky charts in a few formats. The charts can be in rectangular, elliptical or polar formats and currently include the stars from the [IAU catalog of named stars](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/). I'm planning to support other catalogs, such as the [Yale Bright Star Catalog](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html) in the future.

The program can optionally display the ecliptic, the Moon, the Sun and the planets. Their positions are calculated using the algorithms from [this tutorial](http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html). The resulting ephemerides are not very precise but are good enough to be displayed on a computer screen.
